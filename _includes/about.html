                Hello! I'm Cristiano Cabrera, a graduate student at Purdue University delving into the fascinating world of fluid dynamics. My research focuses on passive flow control, especially in the realm of supersonic flow. I'm intrigued by the intricate dance of forces and energies that shape fluid behavior, and I'm passionate about finding innovative solutions to enhance flow efficiency and performance.
